This repository adds apparmor support for the LXQt desktop if it is used with roddhjavs apparmor.d repository https://github.com/roddhjav/apparmor.d.

The LXQt desktop up to version 2.3 is supported. The profiles were tested using Archlinux and Artix Linux running the wayland (kwin & wayfire) and xorg versions along with sddm.

Be prepared to make some adjustments.
