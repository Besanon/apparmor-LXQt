This repository lists the most recent changes of the apparmor profiles for the LXQt desktop.
These profiles are based on Roddhjavs apparmor.d repository https://github.com/roddhjav/apparmor.d where the LXQt section can also be found. In order to run the profiles you need to install roddhjavs repository first.

It supports the LXQt desktop version 2.3. The profiles were tested using Archlinux and Artix Linux running the wayland (kwin & wayfire) and xorg versions along with sddm.

Be prepared to make some adjustments.
